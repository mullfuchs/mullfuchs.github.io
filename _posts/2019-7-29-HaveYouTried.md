# Have You Tried Applying Online

## Content Warning: Suicide, Self Harm, Body Horror

The networking event was in a large brewery in downtown Seattle. They took sips of some kind of light microbrew beer. A lager of some kind. Heavier drinks like IPAs tended to make them sleepy. 

They were a tech recruiter at a mid sized software company. There had been a recent push to expand the live operations department. Tonight they were at a tech meet up blah blah blah

“Hi” a nebbish man in a casual button up shirt approached them “My name is Hansel, I saw you were hiring for a Live Systems operations engineer” 

“Great” they said “we really had headcount open up, so I’m not super familiar with all the positions we’re hiring, sorry, I’m new at the company”

“Uh” the recruiter paused “Have you tried applying online?” 

Hansels face twisted a little bit in recoil as he took a sip of his own beer “Yes”

“Great!” The recruiter said “I know it can take a few days to filter through applications”

“I applied 4 weeks ago” Hansel said, blank faced. He took another, larger sip of his beer. As he tipped his hand up, the recruiter noticed that Hansels left hand was badly bandaged up.

“Oh my, what happened to your hand?” The recruiter said

“I’m sorry” hansel said, crestfallen. half dropping the beer on the table, turning away and pushing through the crowd.

The Recruiter paused in a kind of stunned silence. The beer glass had a small amount of blood on it.

It was the next day in the office

“Hey did you know what they found in one of the bathrooms at last nights mixer? a severed finger”

“A what? There was a guy there with a bandaged hand. He was asking about one of our live ops positions” The Recruiter said, feeling more and more alarmed

“Well did they apply online?”

“They said they did four weeks ago” The Recruiter replied

“Oh, well then the Application Tracking System probably rejected them” 

The Application Tracking System, or ATS, is a fancy piece of software that lives on a web server somewhere. When a company wants to hire, they post job listings online for people to apply to. When a person applies, the software takes their application and does a algorithmic keyword match to the job listing. If there’s a match the application is sent to the recruiter, who then makes contact with the applicant. It’s an easy way to filter though the many hundreds of applications employers get when they post a job listing.

The Recruiter knew that the ATS was a new addition in the last 6 months, installed before their arrival, and so they were still getting used to how it worked and how to best create job listings. Often they would inflate the job requirements, knowing that no one would fit them all, to cast a wider net. They would often only have a few applications get through, but all the ones that did seemed to still be under qualified. 

The Recruiter, however, got the position from a friend’s referral, an old college field hockey teammate.

“I’m not sure if the ATS is working correctly” The Recruiter said

“Have you submitted a service ticket?”

“No not yet” The Recruiter replied

Hansel left his business card. It was a small white rectangle with his full name and “Live Ops Engineer” Underneath in a neat sans-serif font. On the back of his card was a url with his online job profile, a site that tracked the computer code they wrote, and a portfolio of past work. The Recruiter, out of more curiosity than obligation, glanced at Hansel’s portfolio. It was a smarty designed website with a few personal flourishes. The exact thing that The Recruiter was looking for in an applicant. A brief reading revealed Hansels job history: Live Operations Engineering. This was the exact thing The Recruiter was looking for. With a few small exceptions, Hansel had everything they were looking for. 

“That’s weird” The Recruiter remarked, out loud, to no one. 

Since the Live Ops department was growing and had a need for “More bodies”, and the ATS hadn’t produced a qualified candidate, The Recruiter decided to reach out via Hansel’s phone number.

“Hansel’s Dead” a voice on the other end of the line said, between sobs. 

“Oh, I’m terribly sorry, I’m a Recruiter at The Company and Hansel introduced himself last night” The Recruiter stammered out

“Oh God” the voice on the line said “Hansel had been looking for a job for so long, he told me he applied 4 weeks ago” 

The voice on the other end grew angrier “Why didn’t you call back before? what the fuck took you so long”

The Recruiter quickly hung up after stammering out an apology. Dropping the phone on their desk in stunned shock.

“Hi, my name is Grendal, I’m a Live Ops engineer in the Seattle area. I saw that you were hiring for a live ops engineering position at The Company and I wanted to send you my resume” Read an email that appeared in The Recruiter’s inbox.

The Recruiter got emails like this all the time, they quickly skimmed the applicant’s resume and saw that they were indeed a Live Operations engineer. Their qualifications seemed to match what The Company was looking for. The Recruiter sent a response.

“Hi Grendal. Thank you for reaching out. Have you applied to the position on our website? That’s the best way for us to get in contact with you and schedule a phone screen. Thank you!” 

Moments later, The Recruiter got a response back “Yes, I did apply on the website two weeks ago. If you look at my resume and job skills you’ll see I’m a very good fit for the role. I have 4 years experience as a Live Ops engineer at a company in a similar field. I’d love to meet sometime and discuss the role with you and what I can bring to the company”

The Recruiter was a bit annoyed, they didn’t have time to meet with every single person who applied. They thought about Hansel and recoiled at the idea of possibly meeting with another unstable person who wanted the job. But, they needed a live ops engineer, and Grendal seemed as though they would sail through the application process.

“I hear you loud and clear. I’d be happy to send your application forward if you meet our job requirements. Can you send me your application confirmation number? You should have gotten one when you sent in your application” The Recruiter replied.

They got up and got coffee, as they did whenever they didn’t want to sit at their desk and think about anything.

When they returned, Grendal had sent a response, it was just the application number, devoid of any other message or any other words. The Recruiter felt annoyed because the message, without any purfunctionary wording, came off as curt and impolite. Even more annoying to The Recruiter was that the ATS sends a link to the applicant via the Application System’s internal messaging system. The ATS required applicants to make an account to apply, and the account had a messaging system with which The Company could send application statuses, but these often also went to Email. 

The Recruiter logged into the ATS’s administration interface and put in the application number, it returned an error.

“I’m sorry, there must be a bug in the system” The Recruiter said “It doesn’t seem like you’ve applied to the position. Could you try applying again and send me the link to you application confirmation? You should get one in your ATS inbox” The Recruiter replied. This was getting annoying.

A few moments later they got a single word response back from Grendal

“pleas” 

The Recruiter sighed. 

“I’m sorry but without a valid application I cannot move you forward in the system” The Recruiter replied.

The Recruiter was shopping for food one day. They were tapped on the shoulder and were face to face with a thin, sweaty, and pale faced man. 

“I’m sorry?” The Recruiter said “Do you need something”

“I…” the man stammered. The Recruiter looked behind the man and noticed a trail of blood. Blood was dripping down the mans hands and onto the tile of the supermarket. Blood was soaking through the sleeves of his white pinstripe button up shirt, turning it a dark shade of crimson

The man produced a piece of paper, now soaked in blood

“My name is Renard, I’m a live operations engineer and I have 6 years of Live Ops experience at…” the man trailed off, fainting in front of The Recruiter from the loss of blood, clutching his resume.

The Recruiter recalled the events to the police, who seemed nonplussed and a little annoyed Renard had been declared dead on site instead of at a Hospital, requiring an excessive amount of paperwork.

“So, the resume” The Recruiter said “Can I read it? if it was meant for me?”

“It’s evidence” The Officer said flatly, before turning away “That will be all”

It was 2 in the morning when The Recruiter got a phone call. They didn’t recognize the number, and figured it was spam. Annoyed that someone would call them at this hour they hung up and blocked the number. Moments later a different number called. Blocked. A third. A fourth. Out of anger The Recruiter answered one, knowing it would just encourage the spammers to keep calling.

“Hello” a raspy voice on the end of the line said “My name is Indigo. I noticed you were…hiring for a Live Ops engineer. I have extensive experience in Live Ops support and a masters degree in computer science from”

“Excuse me? How did you get this number?” The Recruiter said with concern. 

“I’ve been trying for months” Indigo said. 

“GOD DAMN IT” Indigo screamed “Please just interview me. please just get me in touch with the engineering department. Please. I worked with Greg before he left for The Company. He knows who I am, he can vouch for me”

“Okay. Did you apply online?” The Recruiter asked “Tell me how you got this number”

“I…” Indigo stammered “I cut out my eye”

“What!” The Recruiter’s blood ran cold. Time seemed to stop.

“I cut out my fucking eye! My fucking eye! to get this number!” Indigo said, pleading between sobs “Please get me in contact with your engineering department”

“You need help, call an ambulance!” The Recruiter said out of shock. They didn’t know what to do for them. 

“I don’t have health insurance!” Indigo screamed on the other end of the line. Somehow his cries became a twisted howl. The Recruiter hung up immediately. They weren’t sure if they could call the police, they were too stunned and bewildered to react. They fell asleep, waking up unsure if what transpired was a dream.

“Something strange has been happening. I’ve been getting contacted by people who’ve applied to our Live Ops engineering position but they seem that they haven’t gotten through our ATS” The recruiter said, recalling the past week’s events.

“God, People are fucking crazy. The fucking crazies. Always entitled to a handout” The Recruiter’s manager said. “This is why we have an ATS system, to filter out the crazies.” 

“Yeah” The Recruiter said

“If you keep getting these kinds of messages, just refer people to the website and then cut off contact”

“But Live Ops keeps telling us that they need someone to fill their new overnight position, and we can’t find anyone” The Recruiter said

“Live Ops always wants more bodies, they’ve been just fine over the last few quarters, we want a culture fit, remember the Six Success Points?” The Recruiter’s Boss replied, brow furrowed.

“Okay, that makes sense” The Recruiter replied

“Do you know anyone from your Field Hockey days that could do the job? That are good with computers?” The Recruiter’s Boss replied. The Recruiter seemed to remember a friend of a friend who was really into gaming, which was sort of like computers.
