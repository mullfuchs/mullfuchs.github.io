# Twitter 2021

---

I started keeping my cellphone in the bathroom, per my therapists's instructions, but had been falling off the wagon recently. I had drafted a take on the The Last Of Us 3 and was waiting for a mutual of mine to start posting before I dropped it, so they might retweet it to their highly connected follower list, and I could casually drop in my Looking For A Gig tweet underneath after it had "done the numbers". But none of that happened and I slept with the device, again.

Twitter introduced Video Of The Day, which was impossible to block on the app. It would take videos sent in "From all sides" in an attempt to appear neutral. What this meant is that every few hours there was another wave of...well it. I am bracing for the takes every morning. This morning the video is about a cat doing a little dance. When the video closes I'm confronted with a very stern tweet thread about the bone structure of felines and experience emotional whiplash.

Unfunny User from Something Awful who parlayed a Weird Twitter celebrity status into a book deal unfortunatly uttered "my wife" during a livestream promotion for a mattress company. There were about a dozen or so "Mattress Wife" jokes when I woke up, and I couldn't figure out where it came from, and I couldn't decide if I should mute "Wife" again, mute "Mattress" or a combination of phrases. This was all rendered moot when they tweeted an apology but spelled it "Matress", which causes another round of unfunny jokes.

I spend the morning trying to work on a gif for my game. This gif is going to go on #screenshotsaturday, so I usually try to do a good one each month which takes a few days to create. I wonder if I can get @DoesTheGameHaveAFart twitter account to retweet it, as it's coming up on popularty, but isn't too big yet to "Do The Numbers". I spend a few hours and do a few takes of action before recording it at the precise FPS and length, and encode it with the precise settings for it to be 60fps and loop perfectly. Like last time, I wait for my Important Indie Game Mutual to start tweeting before I push it out. "Just testing a few things" I say. But to my horror twitter switched up how encoding works, creating a bunch of ugly artifacts in the gif. Worse: they downgraded the FPS to 45, creating a choppy mess. A bunch of polite Likes appear underneath from people who care about me, and I hate myself for cursing the likes. The Likes aren't Retweets. How is this going to "Do The Numbers" if people only like something. I could complain about it, but that would be petty. I consider adding a fart to the game.
Goldman Sachs twitter account spent the morning tweeting at the Hunts Ketchup twitter account, who then posted screenshots of DMs. Moments later there was a link to "top 10 soft drink twitter replies to the Goldman Sachs Ketchup DMs" with Sunkist at the top with "Mustard slide into my DMs, sweaty :)"

Introducing mutli-quote retweets, where you could embed up to 3 tweets in a retweet, caused a new level of hell to appear overnight. I ended up muting 'Breakfast, lunch, and dinner'. Someone who was a victim of this did a multi-threaded reply but spelled it 'diner', which caused havoc for my feed until I could mute it.

When twitter limited the number of muted words you could use, it felt like cruelty. People were agog. Soon we were swapping out which words to mute for the best effectiveness. I kept a long list of 15 words, plus 5 loose words as crisises popped up and boiled over. Sometimes this worked, but sometimes people would misspell, and, well, it wouldn't work anymore.

I think I've had enough, when just as I'm about to close the app, Important Mutual retweets a quote retweet from The Important Indie Game Publisher. They're quote retweeting a gameplay gif with the response of "Hey our dms are open :)". I can't leave. I could "Do The Numbers" one day. I could get that quote retweet. If only I was funnier, I'd gain better Mutuals, Mutuals who's Personal Brand was also the aesthetic of my gameplay gifs, who would certainly retweet it. Yes, just a few more funny hot takes and jokes. That's all it would need. I assure myself as i close my eyes and go to sleep, shitty device in hand.
