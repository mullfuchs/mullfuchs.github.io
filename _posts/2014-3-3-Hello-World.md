What a tragedy, I've created a blog but have nothing to write

This last week I started making more commitments to full time indie game development, and by that I mean I went to a meetup and watched probably too many GDC talks on the biz side of things. 10 Things Indie Developers Should Totally Not Do. Top 10 Indie failures. If you're not doing these 4 things your indie game will absolutly fail. 

A common theme with these talks is they were, the vast majority of them, done after some measure of success. After several hours of videos it had felt as if I had stuck my head in a large sauce pan and had an entire rugby team hit it with wooden spoons.

Indie Game Dev is, basically, entrepreneurship. Instead of trying to pitch some awful product on CNBC's awful "Shark Tank" to a bunch of indifferent capitalists, you're trying to pitch a videogame to indifferent capitalists. Products fulfill a want or a need. Nobody needs a videogame, really, so what do people want?

Of the majority of the developers that I've seen talks of or talked to in person, that thing that the audience wants is novel game mechanics, delivered with a perfectly balanced game system of some kind that offers easy to learn but hard to master game mechanics, that can be played in perpetuity and forever. Basically the platonic ideal of a videogame is Tetris. The things that people really respond to- things like characters and story and aesthetics - those are just things to stack on top of the core mechanics of the game.

To get this core mechanical system, you work on a bunch of small prototypes until you get a eureka moment. You then build out the prototype into something you can pitch to a botique publisher. To pitch to a publisher you build enough of the game to make the flashiest most spectacular 5 second animated gif, which you email to publishers. You show the game off at conventions, like PAX or the GDC, or Indicade. I think you stand in front of a laptop and demo the game to the wandering masses. Eventually you bring on a musician and a real artist to maybe make the game look like what a game is supposed to look like and sound like a game is supposed to look like. You cut a Steam trailer that is 5 seconds of gameplay footage, then the name, then more gameplay footage. You start a discord and a subreddit to build a community, streaming development as you push to release. Eventually you start coordinating with streamers to hand out early builds to in order to build launch hype. You hit the big blue button that says "Launch". 

Then after several years of major work and strife, you end up selling like 1000 units. You're going to write a blog post on gamasutra on how you did everything right and still failed. People will blame the "indiepocolypse" or the huge glut of games on steam. "This game didn't respond well because of X" is what some indie game talking head will say, tut tut. Then that will be that. No Game 2. Usually.

The inherient problem here is that capitalism forces all of us to be salesmen for ourselves, no matter what we do. Our skills and labor are only valuable in proportion to how we try and sell them. 

In any case, what I'm about to do is set a large portion of my life savings on fire so, for a period of 3-4 months, I have slightly more time to work on this game I've been working on haltingly for the past 2 years. I'm going to spend a few months making the best animated gif of it possible so I can email them to publishers, and hope to secure enough money to continue the project for another 18 months. This is so fuckign dumb hrnnnngnggggg
